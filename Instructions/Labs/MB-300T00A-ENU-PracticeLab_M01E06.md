**Publish Views**

The publish views feature lets you publish a saved view to a security role. This means that any user that has that security role assigned will also be able to see the saved view you have published. This is a way that super users or power users can define how they want a form to look like for specific users and then standardize it so everyone has the same view.

1. Click the “**Publish**” button in the “**Manage my views**” form or in the views drop down

2. In the section called “**Publish to people in these roles”** select the security roles that you want the view to be accessible to by clicking the “Add” button and selecting the security role(s)

3. In the “**Legal entity access**” section ,define if it should be available in specific legal entities or all legal entities and then select **Publish**.

4. Assign the role and  go back to the “**Released products**” form and click the views drop down. The saved view is visible again because it was published to the security role that is now assigned to my user
