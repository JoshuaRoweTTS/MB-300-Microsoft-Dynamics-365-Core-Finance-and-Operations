## Exercise 7: Set up Number Sequence

Number sequences are used to generate readable, unique identifiers for master data records and transaction records that require them. A master data or transaction record that requires an identifier is referred to as a reference.

Before you can create new records for a reference, you must set up a number sequence and associate it with the reference. You can set up all required number sequences at the same time by using the Set-up number sequences wizard, or you can create or modify individual number sequences by using the Number sequences page.

Scenario: your company wants a specific pattern for a certain type of general journal. Below steps provides you a series of options available to set up a number sequence. 

Instructions

1. Navigate to **Organization administration** > **Number sequences** **Number sequences**.
