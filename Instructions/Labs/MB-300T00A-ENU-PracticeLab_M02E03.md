## Exercise 3: Run a security report and analyze the output

Finance and Operations apps security reports can be found under **Modules** > **System administration** > **Inquiries** > **Security**. Letâ€™s run and analyze some of these security reports.

### Task 1: User role assignments

The **User role assignments** report generates a view of the current user role assignments in your system. By default, the report includes all users with roles assigned. You can limit the report to a specific set of users by entering them when generating the report.

1. Select **Modules** from the left navigation bar > **System administration** > **Inquiries** > **Security** > **User role assignments**.

2. On the **User role assignments** report parameters pane, navigate to **Records to include** > **Filter.**

3. From there, you can add or remove filters to the list of users. A list of roles is provided for each user in the report, along with any restrictions at the legal entity or organization level.

4. Select **OK** to apply any filters that you have selected, then click **OK** to run the report.

5. View the results.


### Task 2: Role to user assignments

The **Role to user assignment** report provides an aggregation of role assignments. Expanding a role in the report shows the list of users assigned to the role, and expanding the user name shows any restrictions the role has applied. You can apply the same method for filtering the set of users to this report as described for the **User role assignments** report.

1. Select **Modules** from the left navigation bar > **System administration** > **Inquiries** > **Security** > **Role to user assignments.**

2. On the report parameters pane, navigate to **Records to include** > **Filter.**

3. From there, you filter by User ID and then select **OK**.

4. Select **OK** and then View the results.

### Task 3: Security role access

The **Security role access** report provides a view of the effective permissions for each security role. This report provides a flattened list of permissions grouped by type across all sub-roles, duties, and privileges contained in the role.

This report may take some time to run, since its data set backing can be very large. If it is the first time the report has run, or there could be changes to the role definitions, the **Rebuild collection** option should be set to **Yes**. You can limit the roles included in the report by adding a filter under **Records to include**.

1. Select **Modules** from the left navigation bar > **System administration** > **Inquiries** > **Security** > **Security role access.**

2. On the report parameters pane, navigate to **Records to include**.

3. From there, you can filter by security role or other fields and select **OK**.

4. Check the roles and then select **OK**.

5. View the results.

Expanding a role shows the category of objects the role has access to. Expanding one of the object types will show a detailed list of each object of that type included in the role.


### Task 4: Security duty assignments

The **Security duty assignments** report provides a view of all the duties contained within a role. This report can be configured to run on any collection of roles, which ensures that segregation of duties is maintained between roles. By default, the report will include each role. To limit the roles included, use the filtering provided in the **Records to include** section.

1. Select **Modules** from the left navigation bar > **System administration** > **Inquiries** > **Security** > **Security duty assignments**.

2. On the report parameters pane, navigate to **Records to include** > **Filter.**

3. From there, you can filter by fields in various tables and then select **OK**.

4. Select **OK**.

5. View the results.

Expanding a role in the **Security duty assignments** report will show each duty assigned to the role, along with details of the duty
